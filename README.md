# GroupProject

This project is like an AirBNB for Cars, Owners of those cars and individuals wanting to rent a vehicle directly from an owner instead of a car rental agency.  Uber Drivers could use this site to find potential vehicles as they conduct their driving business.  Coding included HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Jquery, ASP.NET, AngularJS, C# and SQL.  Since this was a group project for our team, we used Agile MS Team Services and MS Visual Studio 2015 to coordinate the work.
